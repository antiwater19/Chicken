            The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">red junglefowl</a>, originally
            from
            Southeast Asia.
            They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl
            (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).<sub>[1]</sub>

            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[20] In fact, chicken was
                originally
                a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.
                [when?] In older sources, and still often in trade and scientific contexts, chicken as a species are
                typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[21]
