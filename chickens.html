    <p>
        The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from
        Southeast Asia.
        They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl
        (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1]
